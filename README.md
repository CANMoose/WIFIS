# WIFIS-Code

# This repository is depreciated as the content was moved to the WIFIS-Team wifiscontrol repository. 

A repository for all scripts related to controlling WIFIS as well as for data handling.

The control subdirectory should contain all the software which controls various WIFIS components. The data-handling subdirectory should contain all the software that handles the raw WIFIS data.
